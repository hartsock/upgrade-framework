     * <ul>
     * <li> pending iff all child tasks are pending;
     * <li> running iff at least one child is running or pending
     *          but not all children are pending;
     * <li> suspended iff at least one child is suspended
     *          and each other child is either suspended or canceled or failed or completed;
     * <li> canceled iff at least one child is canceled
     *          and each other child is either canceled or failed or completed;
     * <li> failed iff at least one child has failed
     *          and each other child is either failed or completed;
     * <li> completed iff all children are completed;
     * </ul>
     * Parent states calculated by this method are compatible with the state transition diagram
     * defined in {@link ExecutionState}, e.g. valid state transitions of the child states produce
     * valid state transitions of the parent state.
